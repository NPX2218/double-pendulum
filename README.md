# 🧮 Double Pendulum Simulator & Chaos Visualizer

An interactive physics simulation built with **Python Glowscript** and **React** that visualizes the **chaotic motion** of a double pendulum in real time. This project blends theoretical mechanics, mathematics, and intuitive visualization to make complex nonlinear dynamics accessible to learners, educators, and other interested individuals.

## 🚀 Features

- ⚙️ **Real-Time Simulation** – Watch the unpredictable, sensitive motion of a double pendulum evolve step-by-step.
- 📜 **Lagrangian Mechanics** – Full equations of motion derived from first principles using the Euler-Lagrange formulation.
- 🖋️ **Handwritten Derivations** – Included annotated handwritten notes and LaTeX-based steps for deeper insight into the math.
- 📉 **Energy Conservation Checks** – Visual confirmation of total energy throughout the simulation to validate the model.
- 🌀 **Chaos in Action** – Highlight how tiny changes in initial conditions produce wildly different outcomes — a core feature of deterministic chaos.
- 🎓 **Educational Design** – Designed with clarity and learning in mind, perfect for students studying mechanics, math, or chaos theory.
